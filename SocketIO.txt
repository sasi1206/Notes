Socket IO is library thats built on webSockets but has many extra features like broadcasting , groups , fallback
pooling, auto re-connection. and all

It's also event driven means we can emit custom event from client/server and catch in on client/server.

Additionally we can also create groups.

io.emit() - Send to all sockets
socket.emit() - Send to connected socket
socket.broadcast - Send to all sockets but expect connected socket.
io.to(room).emit() - Send to specific room and all connected members
socket.broadcast.to(grp).emit - Send to specific room but expect connected socket

socket.on - catch emitted function.
socket.on(event,listener);

socket.leave(room) - leaves room
socket.join(room) - join a room
