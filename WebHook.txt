Webhook is a way to communicate with applications automatically when a event happens

It's essentially a event driven http request sender they act as a callback mechanism.
it usually include a payload (data) in their request

For example,

Payment providers,

We( in our app ) creates a order and send it to payment providers and we( in our server ) will have 
a API endpoint which listens to payment changes and we gives this endpoint to payment providers and creates 
a webhook by saying "whenever state of payment changes" send a request to this endpoint

This is webhook.
 
Why it's called "webhook"

Take it as this, your fishing and ur fishing rod will have a hook. Why? So that whenever a fish takes 
bait it shows you and you catch the fish


Like this we create a hook to another application and when a specified event happens it sends a http request
