WebSockets is full-duplex communication protocol where client,server can send,receive msgs at the same time
it sends to request to server to establish a connection once it connected we can send,receive msgs easily

keeping in mind that WebSockets is used to send and receive msgs from client to server so we can't create a chat application fully.

take it as calling someone we call them and if they we can talk and it stops if any one of connection ends.
