Web3 in third generation of websites. its built on block chain technologies mainly made for decentralization,
permission less websites.

before that what is centralization?

Centralized systems are those where control, authority, and decision-making are concentrated in a single entity or location.
This means that one organization, government, or individual has the power to regulate and manage operations, rather than distributing
control among multiple independent participants.

it means one entity will control what user see , how user should behave , having control over user like in instagram, it has a privacy 
policy,and user can only post story/post that goes with policy if not they can remove it. and it has a reels where it shows content to
user uniquely and all

web3 uses block chain too.
so what is blockchain?

its a network where data's are stored as block and once it written we can't change or delete it. Every person in blockchain can see the 
blocks and everyone have their own copy. so if in case a person changes something on their computer. we can verify it by comparing others.
we can't hack blocks cause every blocks are chain each other.
